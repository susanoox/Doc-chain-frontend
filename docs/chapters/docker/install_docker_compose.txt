Docker Compose installation
===========================

#. Install Docker:

   .. code-block:: console

       wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh

   If you don't want to run an automated script, follow the instructions
   outlined in their documentation: https://docs.docker.com/install/


#. Download the Mayan EDMS Docker Compose files:

   The files are located at: https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/-/tree/master/docker/

   .. code-block:: console

       curl https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/-/raw/master/docker/docker-compose.yml -O
       curl https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/-/raw/master/docker/.env -O


#. Launch the Mayan EDMS Docker Compose containers:

   .. code-block:: console

       docker compose up --detach

   .. note::

       There is no need to restart the containers after a shutdown, the
       containers in the Docker Compose file are set to start automatically.


Customization
-------------

#. Update the Mayan EDMS Docker Compose file:

   Update the ``docker-compose.yml`` file directly or the ``.env`` in the
   same folder where the file ``docker-compose.yml`` resides.
   Add an entry for each of the environment variables to change.

   .. note::

       If the ``.env`` file does not reside in the same folder where the
       ``docker-compose.yml`` is or you choose another filename for it,
       the option ``--env-file <you env file path>`` needs to be added
       to every ``docker compose`` invocation.


#. Verify the configuration changes:

   .. code-block:: console

       docker compose --file docker-compose.yml --project-name mayan config

   This command will output the Docker Compose file, using the values of your
   ``.env`` file.


Additional commands
-------------------

- Invoking from and external folder:

  .. note::

      If you are invoking the ``docker compose`` command outside the
      directory where the file ``docker-compose.yml`` resides,
      you need to add the ``--file docker-compose.yml`` option.


- Multiple deployments:

  Multiple deployments can be made from the same ``docker-compose.yml``
  file by using the ``--project-name <project_name>`` option.


- To view the logs of the containers:

  .. code-block:: console

      docker compose logs


- To list the containers:

  .. code-block:: console

      docker compose ps --all


- To terminate the containers:

  .. note::

      Once terminated, the containers are removed and only the data volumes
      remain.

  .. code-block:: console

      docker compose down
