Version 4.3.12
==============

Released: December 10, 2023

Status: Stable


Changes
-------

This version merges fixes and updates from series 4.2.


DevOps
^^^^^^

Updated the GitLab CI deployment stage to not install the Docker runtime.
The staging and demo environments are expected to already have Docker
installed.


Docker
^^^^^^

Updated the Docker image ``entrypoint.sh`` to skip changing the ownership
of files if ``MAYAN_COMMON_DISABLE_LOCAL_STORAGE`` is set to any truthy
value (``True``, ``true``, ``T``, ``t``, ``Yes``, ``yes``, ``Y``, ``y``,
``1``).

Use long form for the command options in Dockerfile.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

Fixed the document file page search content field label. This issue did not
affect search function, only the label of the field in the search form.


File caching
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updated the cache and cache partition purge loop to continue executing even
when there are files that cannot be purged. Cache partition files will be
skipped and retried on the next purge execution.


Metadata
^^^^^^^^

Fixed the ``select2`` widget of the metadata edit workflow action form.


Sources
^^^^^^^

Merged minor source periodic task changes. Use a constant instead of a
literal to track the name of the source action execute task.


Storages
^^^^^^^^

Fixed the ``add_file`` method of the ``TarArchive`` class.


Testing
^^^^^^^

Fixed test that were asserting for True values instead of asserting for
equality.


Other
^^^^^

- Add event asserts in tests.
- Code style fixes.
