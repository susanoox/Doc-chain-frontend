Version 4.0.14
==============

Released: August 5, 2021

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Converter
^^^^^^^^^
A bug was fixed that affected converter layer exclusion for layers with a
priority of 0. This fixes the preview layer priority when editing the
redactions of pages that also contain transformations in other layers.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

Fixed a regression that made it impossible to change the document version page
image cache maximum size setting. The regression was found in the setting
change callback.
