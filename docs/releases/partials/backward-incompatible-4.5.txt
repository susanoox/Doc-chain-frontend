Docker
^^^^^^

Renamed all environment variables containing ``POSTGRES`` to use the full
name ``POSTGRESQL``. These are: ``MAYAN_DOCKER_KEYCLOAK_POSTGRES_TAG``,
``MAYAN_KEYCLOAK_POSTGRES_VOLUME``, ``MAYAN_DOCKER_POSTGRES_IMAGE``,
``MAYAN_POSTGRES_VOLUME``.

Rename any usage of these variables in your ``.env`` file.

Documents
^^^^^^^^^

Removal of the setting ``DOCUMENTS_STUB_EXPIRATION_INTERVAL``. Document
stub expiration interval is now configure on a per document type basis via
the user interface or API.

Removal of the unused signal ``signal_post_document_created``. Use Django's
default ``post_save`` signal for documents or
``signal_post_document_file_upload`` to handle new file uploads.

Deleting a document file is now a background task and not an immediate
operation. The document file view and API view are updated to reflect this.
The result code of the document file deletion API view has changed from
204 (No content) to 202 (Accepted).


Document file actions now use a short name instead of a non descriptive
number. The new action names are as follow:

1 is now 'replace'
2 is now 'append'
3 is now 'keep'

Likewise the API field has changed from 'action' to 'action_name'.

The queue named `uploads` has been split into multiple new queues. Ensure
that the `uploads` queue is empty (there are no pending uploads or uploads
in progress) before performing the upgrade. Failure to do so will
cause pending uploads to be ignored and then deleted at the next
garbage collection cycle.


Sources
^^^^^^^

Removal of YAML metadata attachments in email sources.

Removal of sender, subject, and message ID metadata collection.

Staging folder and watch folder now only work with real files and ignore
symlinks.


Task manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Removal of the "Tools" queue. Each app must now define its own queue for
slow, long lived operations.


Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

The ``WorkflowTemplateStateActionSerializer`` field ``action_path`` is
now called ``backend_path``, and the field ``action_data`` is now called
``backend_data``.

The workflow template state action template no longer has direct access to
the document to which the workflow is attached via the variable
``{{ document }}``. To access the document, do so indirectly via the
``{{ workflow_instance }}`` variable with
``{{ workflow_instance.document }}``.
