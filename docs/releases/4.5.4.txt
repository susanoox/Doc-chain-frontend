Version 4.5.4
=============

Released: October 4, 2023

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Docker
^^^^^^

Improved how caches and proxies are calculated to allow more configurations
of PYPI and APT caches. Added support for upstream Docker image mirroring.
These changes greatly speed up Docker image building directly and via
GitOps.


GitLab CI
^^^^^^^^^

Support invalid characters in Docker registry login username. Support
invalid CI characters like "$", such as those generated by Harbor for robot
accounts.


Sources
^^^^^^^

Support runtime source action execution logic. Added the method
``get_allow_action_execute`` to provide each source control to allow or
ignore action execution.

Improve email testing code to capture more edge cases.

Fixed the interpretation of the dry run value for periodic sources. This
fixes the post document upload clean up of the email, watch folder, and
watch storages sources.
