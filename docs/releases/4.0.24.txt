Version 4.0.24
==============

Released: April 14, 2023

Status: End of life

Changes
--------


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To ensure deeper level of immutability in version dependency containers are
now pinned to specific bug fix versions.


Development
^^^^^^^^^^^

The makefile target used to setup the development environment was split
into targets that install OS and Python dependencies.

Duplicated makefile target were removed.

A system check named ``check_app_tests`` was backported. This check ensures
Mayan apps tests flag matches the actual state of the app's tests.


Organizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The organization app had tests but the app setting specifying the
presence of tests was set to false.


Task manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Improvements to the ``CeleryQueue`` class were backported to enable task
manager app tests.
