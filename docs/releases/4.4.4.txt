Version 4.4.4
=============

Released: February 14, 2023

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Authentication OTP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The interface of the library used for generating QRCodes changed and broke
the OTP QRCode generation. The image interface was updated, a new test added,
and the entire QRCode generation simplified to lower the changes of future
regressions.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Python Transifex client was remove and replace with the new Go based
client. This client is OS dependent and needs to be installed manually
when working with translations (https://github.com/transifex/cli).


Document indexing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An edge case was fixed where index levels with blank values would cause the
empty index instance node clean up routine to incorrectly delete index
instance nodes containing other document references, requiring a rebuild.
A partial patch from a future index optimization was backported to enact the
correct behavior.


REST API
^^^^^^^^

The validation errors in the document metadata API were incorrectly causing
HTTP 500 server errors. A custom REST API exception handler was added to
workaround inconsistent validation exception behavior in the Django REST
framework and ensure validation error raise a HTTP 400 error instead.
