Version 4.2.18
==============

Released: December 9, 2023

This version includes fixes backported from series 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and
4.6dev0.


Changes
-------


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updated dependency versions:

- Django from version 3.2.19 to 3.2.23.
- ``PyYAML`` from version 5.4.1 to 6.0.1.
- ``drf-yasg`` from version 1.20.0 to 1.21.7.


DevOps
^^^^^^

Updated the GitLab CI deployment stage to not install the Docker runtime.
The staging and demo environments are expected to already have Docker
installed.


Docker
^^^^^^

Use the Mayan EDMS CLI script full path in DockerFile. This avoid command
resolution issues in some situations.

Updated the Docker image ``entrypoint.sh`` to skip changing the ownership
of files if ``MAYAN_COMMON_DISABLE_LOCAL_STORAGE`` is set to any truthy
value (True, true, T, t, Yes, yes, Y, y, 1).


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

Fixed the document file page search content field label. This issue did not
affect search function, only the label of the field in the search form.

Used the correct field when sorting document file pages.


File caching
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updated the cache and cache partition purge loop to continue executing even
when there are files that cannot be purged. Cache partition files will be
skipped and retried on the next purge execution.


Mailing
^^^^^^^

Added missing mailing profile ``default`` field to creation and edit forms.


Metadata
^^^^^^^^

Fixed the ``select2`` widget of the metadata edit workflow action form.


Sources
^^^^^^^

Backported minor source periodic task changes.


Storages
^^^^^^^^

Fixed the ``add_file`` method of the ``TarArchive`` class.


Testing
^^^^^^^

Fixed test that were asserting for True values instead of asserting for
equality.
