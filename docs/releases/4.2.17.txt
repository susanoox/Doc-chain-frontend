==============

Released: July 10, 2023

Status: Maintenance


Changes
-------


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

Ensure only the filename of the uploaded file is used as the document
label, omitting all path content.

The valid document is now referenced as the event target when restoring a
trashed document to allow the event to be accessible.


MIME type
^^^^^^^^^

Backported MIME type file command backend improvements to make it more
usable in series 4.2.

The ``file`` command in now included in the Docker image to allow using it
for MIME type detection.


Sources
^^^^^^^

Fixed the POP3 source uncompress choices. The choice asking users was not
valid for a non interactive source.

The error log is now only cleared if the source is enabled or was being
tested.
