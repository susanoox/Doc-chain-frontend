Version 4.5.11
==============

Released: March 28, 2024

Changes
-------

This version includes the changes from version 4.4.14 plus the following:


Credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix the model model resolution order to ensure the ``post_processing``
method is called always.

Fine tuned the commit of the "credential used" event.


Search
^^^^^^

Lowered the severity of searching indexing problems to ``INFO``. This reduces
user confusion between normal messages when processing the asynchronous task
queue and actual coding errors.


Sources
^^^^^^^

Fixed the periodic source document type field to use the intended "Select2"
widget.

Added additional sources migrations for users that skipped the previous
migrations during the upgrade.


Storage
^^^^^^^

Fixed .msg file uncompressed uploads.


Other
^^^^^

- Fix workflow transition field model typo.
