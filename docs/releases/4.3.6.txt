Version 4.3.6
=============

Released: February 19, 2023

Status: Stable

Changes
-------

This version backports fixes from versions 4.4.3 and 4.4.4.


Authentication OTP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The interface of the library used for generating QRCodes changed and broke
the OTP QRCode generation. The image interface was updated, a new test added,
and the entire QRCode generation simplified to lower the changes of future
regressions.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Python Transifex client was remove and replace with the new Go based
client. This client is OS dependent and needs to be installed manually
when working with translations (https://github.com/transifex/cli).


REST API
^^^^^^^^

The validation errors in the document metadata API were incorrectly causing
HTTP 500 server errors. A custom REST API exception handler was added to
workaround inconsistent validation exception behavior in the Django REST
framework and ensure validation error raise a HTTP 400 error instead.


Tags
^^^^

The tag labels are now sanitized when generating the Select2 user interface
widget template. This closes the XSS weakness reported in CVE-2022-47419:
Mayan EDMS Tag XSS.

This is a limited scope weakness of the tagging system markup that can be
used to display an arbitrary text when selecting a tag for attachment to
or removal from a document.

It is not possible to circumvent Mayan EDMS access control system or
expose arbitrary information with this weakness.

Attempting to exploit this weakness requires a privileged account and
is not possible to enable from a guest or an anonymous account. Visitors
to a Mayan EDMS installation cannot exploit this weakness.

It is also being incorrectly reported that this weakness can be used to
steal the session cookie and impersonate users. Since version 1.4
(March 23, 2012) Django has included the ``httponly``
attribute for the session cookie. This means that the session cookie data,
including ``sessionid``, is no longer accessible from JavaScript.
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/releases/1.4/

Mayan EDMS currently uses Django 3.2. Under this version of Django
The ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`` defaults to ``True``, which enables the
``httponly`` for the session cookie making it inaccessible to JavaScript
and therefore not available for impersonation via session hijacking.
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#session-cookie-httponly

Django's ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`` setting is not currently exposed by
Mayan EDMS' setting system, therefore it is not possible to disable this
protection by conventional means.

Any usage of this weakness remains logged in the event system making
it easy to track down any bad actors.

Due to all these factors, the surface of attack of this weakness is
very limited, if any.

There are no known actual or theoretical attacks exploiting this
weakness to expose or destroy data.
