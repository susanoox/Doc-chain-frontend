Version 4.2.14
==============

Released: March 9, 2023

Status: Maintenance


Changes
-------

This version includes fixes and merges from version 4.1.11.


REST API
^^^^^^^^

The validation errors in the document metadata API were incorrectly causing
HTTP 500 server errors. A custom REST API exception handler was added to
workaround inconsistent validation exception behavior in the Django REST
framework and ensure validation error raise a HTTP 400 error instead.


Tags
^^^^

Sanitize tag labels to avoid XSS abuse (CVE-2022-47419: Mayan EDMS Tag XSS).
This is a limited scope weakness of the tagging system markup that can be
used to display an arbitrary text when selecting a tag for attachment to
or removal from a document.

It is not possible to circumvent Mayan EDMS access control system or
expose arbitrary information with this weakness.

Attempting to exploit this weakness requires a privileged account and
is not possible to enable from a guest or an anonymous account. Visitors
to a Mayan EDMS installation cannot exploit this weakness.

It is also being incorrectly reported that this weakness can be used to
steal the session cookie and impersonate users. Since version 1.4
(March 23, 2012) Django has included the ``httponly``
attribute for the session cookie. This means that the session cookie data,
including ``sessionid``, is no longer accessible from JavaScript.
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/releases/1.4/

Mayan EDMS currently uses Django 3.2. Under this version of Django
The ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`` defaults to ``True``, which enables the
``httponly`` for the session cookie making it inaccessible to JavaScript
and therefore not available for impersonation via session hijacking.
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#session-cookie-httponly

Django's ``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`` setting is not currently exposed by
Mayan EDMS' setting system, therefore it is not possible to disable this
protection by conventional means.

Any usage of this weakness remains logged in the event system making
it easy to track down any bad actors.

Due to all these factors, the surface of attack of this weakness is
very limited, if any.

There are no known actual or theoretical attacks exploiting this
weakness to expose or destroy data.


Testing
^^^^^^^

Support multi ``psycopg2`` versions for testing. Upgrade testing now uses
``PYTHON_PSYCOPG_VERSION_PREVIOUS`` to install the previous version of the
library.

  - Add configurable remote branch for GitOps.
  - Add makefile targets to trigger standalone builds.
  - Reuse Python build in stages.
  - Convert branches into literals.
  - Remove duplicated code in jobs.
  - Split GitLab CI targets into their own makefile.
  - Increase artifact expiration.
  - Add PIP and APT caching to documentation and python build
    stages.
  - Add GitLab CI job dependencies.
  - Enable Buildkit builds.
  - Use APT proxy and cache in more places.
  - Cache Alpine APK packages.
  - Clean up cache directory definitions.
  - Update APT cache to be at ``.cache/apt``.
  - Add multi cache support.
  - Add GitLab CI cache template tags.
