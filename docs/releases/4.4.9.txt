Version 4.4.9
=============

Released: October 15, 2023

Status: Stable

This version includes fixes backported from series 4.5.


Docker
^^^^^^

Improved how caches and proxies are calculated to allow more configurations
of PYPI and APT caches. Added support for upstream Docker image mirroring.
These changes greatly speed up Docker image building directly and via
GitOps.

Updated the Docker builder image from version 20.10.21-dind to 23.0.6-dind.
Updated the base Debian image from version debian:11.7-slim to
debian:11.8-slim.

Updated the Docker image ``entrypoint.sh`` to skip changing the ownership
of files if ``MAYAN_COMMON_DISABLE_LOCAL_STORAGE`` is set to any truthy
value (True, true, T, t, Yes, yes, Y, y, 1).


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updated Django from version 3.2.20 to 3.2.22. Updated PIP from version
22.2 to 23.2.1. Updated PyYAML from version 6.0 to 6.0.1.


Task manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Backported periodic task import checking to ensure only valid periodic tasks
are created.


Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

Fixed editing of existing metadata workflow actions.


Other
^^^^^

- Fix the ``add_file`` method for the ``TarArchive`` class.
- Update the GitLab CI deployment stage to not install the Docker runtime.
