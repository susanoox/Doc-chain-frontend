Version 4.4.3
=============

Released: February 11, 2023

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Converter
^^^^^^^^^

The transformation views' URLs were updated to always specify which
content object's transformations are being manipulated. This ensures the
permission system work correctly on all situations such as when deep ACLs
are used to grant access to transformation from a document type.

The transformation and decoration links were updated to take advantage of the
new link dynamic attributes features.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for Python 3.7 and Python 3.8 was dropped for the version 4.4
release. Python 3.9 is now the minimum version supported. This change
happened in version 4.4 but was not documented.


Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^

The `Link` class added support for for dynamic view keyword arguments, icon,
resolved object, and permissions. Instead of accessing the properties
directly the respective ``get_...`` method needs to be used instead. For
example, instead of accessing the link icon with ``link.icon`` use
``link.get_icon()``. The ``.get_`` method accept a ``context`` arguments to
allow the overload method to return different values that can depend on the
view context contents.


Redactions
^^^^^^^^^^

The transformation and decoration links were updated to take advantage of the
new link dynamic attributes features. Redaction access control now works
properly on complex access control scenarios.


Tags
^^^^

The tag labels are now sanitized when generating the Select2 user interface
widget template. This closes the XSS weakness reported in CVE-2022-47419:
Mayan EDMS Tag XSS.

This is a limited scope weakness of the tagging system markup that can be
used to display an arbitrary text when selecting a tag for attachment to or
removal from a document.

It is not possible to circumvent Mayan EDMS access control system or
expose arbitrary information with this weakness.

Attempting to exploit this weakness requires a privileged account and
is not possible to enable from a guest or an anonymous account. Visitors
to a Mayan EDMS installation cannot exploit this weakness.

Any usage of this weakness remains logged in the event system making
it easy to track down any bad actors.

Due to all these factors, the surface of attack of this weakness is
very limited, if any.

There are no known actual or theoretical attacks exploiting this
weakness to expose or destroy data.


Other
^^^^^

- Move transformation and redactions links to either their own ``links.py``
  module. In the case of the ``documents`` app, the module is named
  ``miscellaneous_links.py``.
- Improve transformation and redaction link testing.
