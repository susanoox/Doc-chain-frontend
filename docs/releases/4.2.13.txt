Changes
-------


Docker
^^^^^^

An empty value is now added by default to the Docker Compose variable
``MAYAN_WORKER_CUSTOM_QUEUE_LIST`` to silence a warning about this variable
not being set.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

An issue that prevented the document file and document version print form to
work correctly was fixed.


Other
^^^^^

- Fix tagged document list view permission filtering. The permission
  layout remains the same. Only the method in which the permissions is
  checked was updated.
- Fix metadata add action actor assignment. This assignment is not
  currently used by either the view or the API which assign the actor
  directly themselves.
