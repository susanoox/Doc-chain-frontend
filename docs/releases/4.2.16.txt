Version 4.2.16
==============

Released: May 31, 2023

Status: Maintenance


Changes
-------


Announcements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Disabled the announcements app login template caching. This fixes
announcement texts not changing when edits are made.


CD/CI
^^^^^

CI improvements to the documentation jobs:

  - Install wheel to use modern Python package versions.
  - Don't install or build the Mayan EDMS Python package and
    instead use the development code to build the documentation.
  - Ensure APT proxy quotes are escaped.
  - Move Wheel dependency version to top level config file.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Django was updated from version 3.2.16 to 3.2.19.


Docker
^^^^^^

The variable names for the Docker credential in the staging makefile were
fixed. This change only affects developers running a live staging test.

The Docker Debian image was updated from version 11.4-slim to 11.7-slim.
The Redis Docker image was updated from version 6.2.11-alpine to
6.2.12-alpine.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

The trashed document deletion task is now retries on database
``OperationalError`` exceptions.

On large number of documents or document with many pages, the level
of deletions exceed the database capacity to fulfill them. This
causes a query deadlock where one database process waits for a
ShareLock on a transaction which itself is blocked by another
ShareLock on the previous transaction.

After a timeout period of this circular transaction dependency
an ``OperationalError`` exception will be raised and the trashed
document deletion can be retried.


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The documentation sitemap URL scheme format was updated to remove versioning.
This fixes search engine sitemap generation.

The Flake8 command line was added to the Flake8 check step in the release
chapter.


Search
^^^^^^

The Whoosh backend search object deletion and addition stages are now
separate try and exception blocks. This is functionally the same but allows
for easier debugging and smaller exception blocks with only one statement
per block.


Testing
^^^^^^^

The class ``DocumentTestMixin`` was split into ``DocumentTypeTestMixin`` and
``DocumentTestMixin``.

A task testing module was added to the documents app.

Events assertion was added to the document model tests.


User interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A separate CSS class was created to handle unwanted second scrollbar on forms
with an embedded carousel. So far this only happens on Firefox. This change
also fixes the left and right margin issue with modern Chromium browsers.


Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

A workflow action test was fixed. The test result is the same but was
testing the conditions using the wrong assertion.

The widget definition of the document type change workflow action was
fixed. It nows uses the proper Select2 widget to filter the selection.


Other
^^^^^

- Remove extra punctuation in help text. Text being concatenated already has
  punctuation. This fixes the double periods in some help texts.
