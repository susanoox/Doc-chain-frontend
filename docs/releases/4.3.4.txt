=============

Released: December 19, 2022

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


OCR
^^^

An invalid reference to ``ocr_errors`` in the module
``mayan.apps.ocr.tasks.task_document_version_ocr_finished`` was fixed.
This will allow OCR errors to be accessible once again.


User interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed click events passing through views and action dropdown caret icons.
Activating the dropdown menu by clicking on the menu's caret no longer
selects the document file or version card.


Other
^^^^^

- Merged fixes from version 4.2.13.
- Keep track of the test document versions. Make sure test document versions
  are available to the tests.
- Improve quota testing. Add detailed even checking during quota testing.
