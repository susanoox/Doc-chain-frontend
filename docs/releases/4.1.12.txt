Version 4.1.12
==============

Released: April 14, 2023

Status: End of life

Changes
-------

This version includes fixes from version 4.0.24 and backports from series
4.4, and 4.5dev0.


CD/CI
^^^^^

Local config values are not to be included in the Mayan app settings.
Local config values are meant to override CI/CD and test settings, and not
meant to be committed as permanent to the repository.

Improve the CD deployment stages. Long setting versions are now used for
clarity. Existing Docker volumes are now cleaned up using the official
method. Images are always pulled to ensure the latest copy is used even
if the image has the same tag as the remote such as when building test
images.
