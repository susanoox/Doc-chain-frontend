Version 4.4.6
=============

Released: April 16, 2023

Status: Stable

This version merges fixes and updates from version 4.3.8.


Changes
-------


CD/CI
^^^^^

Local config values are not to be included in the Mayan app settings.
Local config values are meant to override CI/CD and test settings, and not
meant to be committed as permanent to the repository.

Improve the CD deployment stages. Long setting versions are now used for
clarity. Existing Docker volumes are now cleaned up using the official
method. Images are always pulled to ensure the latest copy is used even
if the image has the same tag as the remote such as when building test
images.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updated the Docker image versions tags:

  - Debian from 11.5-slim to 11.6-slim
  - Docker from 20-dind to 20.10.21-dind
  - ElasticSearch from 7.17.0 to 7.17.9
  - MySQL from 8.0 to 8.0.32
  - PostgreSQL from 13.8 to 13.10
  - Python from 3.10-slim to 3.10.11-slim

Docker

The Docker Compose file was updated to work around a backward incompatible
bug introduced in Docker Compose version 2.17.0 YAML processor

Sources
^^^^^^^

Fix sources app migration 0027 backend mapping paths.
