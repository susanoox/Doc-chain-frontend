Security
^^^^^^^^

A patch was added to close Python's vulnerability CVE-2007-4559

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-4559

This is a language level vulnerability which exposed older versions
of Mayan EDMS only when downloading JavaScript dependencies from the NPM
registry.

Exploiting this vulnerability requires compromising an existing package
hosted on the NPM registry and adding Python code specifically targeting
Mayan EDMS. As part of the project's design philosophies, dependencies
are only downloaded from authoritative locations and each dependency is
pinned to a specific version to guarantee immutable releases.

Due to all these factors, the surface of attack of this vulnerability is
very limited for older versions of Mayan EDMS, it is also very improbable,
very difficulty to accomplish and very difficult to remain undetected.

There are no known actual or theoretical attacks for Mayan EDMS
exploiting this vulnerability.


Other
^^^^^

- Add a subclass of ``Path`` that adds the method ``is_relative_to`` for
  Python versions lower than 3.9.
