Document types
==============

The basic unit of data in Mayan EDMS is the **document type**. A document
type can be interpreted also as a document category, a document class, or a
document template. Every other aspect of the system will rely or be tied to
one or more document type. Create one document type for each type or class of
document you intend to upload into Mayan EDMS.

Document types need to be created before documents can be
uploaded. It is not possible to upload documents without assigning them a
document type.

Document types usually mirror the type of physical, paper document they
represent.

Example document types:

* Letter
* Invoice
* Timesheet
* Blueprint

Settings and attributes are applied to document types and documents will
inherit those settings and attributes based on the document type they were
assigned when uploaded into Mayan EDMS. A document can only be of one
type at a given moment, but if needed, the type of a document can be changed.
Upon changing its type, the document will lose its previous settings and
attributes, and will inherit the settings and attributes of its new type.
